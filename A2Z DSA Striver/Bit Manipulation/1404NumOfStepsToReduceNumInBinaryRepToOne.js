/* 1404 Number of steps to reduce a number in Binary Representation to One
29 May 2024 - LC POTD, topic: strig, bit manipulation.
Input: s = "1101"
Output: 6
Explanation: "1101" corressponds to number 13 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 13 is odd, add 1 and obtain 14. 
Step 2) 14 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 3) 7 is odd, add 1 and obtain 8.
Step 4) 8 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 4.  
Step 5) 4 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 6) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.

/* Method 1- simple do what it was said in question
just even number, least significanet bit is 0, for odd it will 1.
TC: O(n^2), SC: O(1)
