An algorithm is a set of well-defined instruction to solve a particular problem.

- Real world example
Ingredients --> Recipe --> Tasty Dish

Cup of Noodle, Taste maker, water --> 1. boil water, 2. pour water into cup, 3. add taste maker, 4. Close lid and wait for 4 min --> output - Tasty Noodles

## Programming

Input --> Algo --> Output.

## Characteristics of Algo
1. well defined inputs and output.
2. each step should be clear
3. language independent.

## Algorithm Analysis
There are multiple ways to solve one problem.
Ex. There are multiple algo to sort a list of numbers.

How do we analyse which one of them is the most efficient algo?
Mostly we measure in Absolutely manners

## Algorithm Analysis Contd.
The absolute running of an algo cannot be predicted, since it depends on a number os factors:
- Programming language used to implement the algo.
- The computer the program runs on
- Other program running at the same time.
- Quality of the operating system.

We evaluate the performance of an algo in terms of its input size.
# Time Complexity: Amount of time taken by an algo to run, as a function of input size.

# Space Complexity: Amount of memory taken by an algo to run, as a function of input size.

## How to represent Complexity?

Asymptotic Notations
-Mathematical tools to represnt time and space complexity
1. Big-O notation - worst case
2. Omega Notation - best case
3. theta notation - average case
