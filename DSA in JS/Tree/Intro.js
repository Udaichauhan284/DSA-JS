/* Tree
- A tree is a hierachical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.
- A tree is a non-linear data structure, compared to arrays, linked list, stacks and queue which are linear data structures.
- In linear data structures, the time required to search is proportional to the size of the data set.
- Tress however, owing to the nonlinear nature allow quicker and easier access to the data.
- A tree not contains any loop or cycle.
