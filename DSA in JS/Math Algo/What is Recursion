/* Recursion 
What? - Recursion is a probelm solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instance of the same problem.
Recursion is when a function calls itself.

Why?
A great technique to simplify your solution.
If you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller versions of the same problem, recursion is very useful.

Every recursive soltion needs to have a base case - a condition to terminate the recursion.
Recursion might simplify slving a problem but it does not always translate to a faster solution. A recursive solution may be far worse compared to an iterative solution.
