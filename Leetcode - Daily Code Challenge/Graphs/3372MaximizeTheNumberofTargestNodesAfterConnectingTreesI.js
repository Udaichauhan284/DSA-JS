/* 3372. Maximize the Number of Target Nodes After Connecting Trees I
28 may 25, Leetcode POTD, Medium
Input: edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4]], edges2 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,7],[1,4],[4,5],[4,6]], k = 2

Output: [9,7,9,8,8]

Explanation:

For i = 0, connect node 0 from the first tree to node 0 from the second tree.
For i = 1, connect node 1 from the first tree to node 0 from the second tree.
For i = 2, connect node 2 from the first tree to node 4 from the second tree.
For i = 3, connect node 3 from the first tree to node 4 from the second tree.
For i = 4, connect node 4 from the first tree to node 4 from the second tree.

/*
For each node in Tree1, find the total number of nodes reachable within distance k from it in Tree1, and add the maximum number of nodes reachable within distance k-1 from any node in Tree2.

üîç Key Steps:
BFS Traversal:

bfs(start, adj, d, N) ‚Üí Counts nodes reachable from start within distance d using Breadth-First Search.

Count for Each Tree:

findCount(edges, d) ‚Üí For each node in the tree, runs BFS to count reachable nodes within d distance.

result1 = findCount(edges1, k) ‚Üí Count for Tree1.

result2 = findCount(edges2, k-1) ‚Üí Count for Tree2.

Combine Results:

Find max value in result2 (i.e., best possible gain from Tree2).

Add this max value to each value in result1.

Return Final Result:

Updated result1 is the answer.

TC: O(N*(N+E)), SC: O(N+E)
